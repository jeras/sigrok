0.1.1 (2012-05-30)
------------------

Note: This release does NOT change the libsigrok API.

 * The 'saleae-logic' driver (which depends on the Saleae firmware), has
   been replaced with the new 'fx2lafw' driver, which uses an open-source
   firmware for Cypress FX2 chips which is also named 'fx2lafw'.
   Details: http://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw
   This new driver (+ firmware) currently supports the following devices:
     - ARMFLY AX-Pro
     - Braintechnology USB-LPS
     - EE Electronics ESLA100
     - EE Electronics ESLA201A
     - Robomotic MiniLogic
     - Robomotic BugLogic 3
     - Saleae Logic
     - USBee AX
     - USBee SX
     - All Cypress FX2 eval boards with stock Cypress VID/PID, including:
       - Lcsoft Mini Board
       - Braintechnology USB Interface V2.x
   Only acquisition with 8 probes is supported so far. Support for 16 probes
   and support for analog signal acquisition (on devices which have these
   capabilities) will be added later.
 * ASIX SIGMA driver:
   - Add support for the ASIX SIGMA2. This requires the latest version of
     the SIGMA/SIGMA2 firmware files.
     Details: http://sigrok.org/wiki/Firmware
   - Various bugfixes.
 * ZEROPLUS Logic Cube LAP-C (16032): Fix a segfault.
 * udev file: Add entries for Robomotic BugLogic 3, Velleman PCSU1000,
   Ideofy LA-08, ARMFLY AX-Pro, and Braintechnology USB Interface V2.x.
 * The zlib dependency has been removed (no longer needed).
 * Fix compiling with "Homebrew" (Mac OS X).
 * libsigrok now expects firmware files in $prefix/share/sigrok-firmware by
   default (was $prefix/share/libsigrok/firmware before).
 * Fix a Makefile.am bug which caused the generated ChangeLog files being
   accidentally deleted upon 'make distclean'.
 * ChronoVu LA8 input file format: Improve autodetection of the file format.
   We now only accept files of the size 8388613 bytes (all LA8 files have
   exactly this amount of bytes).
