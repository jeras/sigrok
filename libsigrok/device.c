/**
 * Scan the system for attached logic analyzers / devices.
 *
 * This will try to autodetect all supported logic analyzer devices:
 *
 *  - Those attached via USB (can be reliably detected via USB VID/PID).
 *
 *  - Those using a (real or virtual) serial port (detected by sending
 *    device-specific commands to all OS-specific serial port devices such
 *    as /dev/ttyS*, /dev/ttyUSB*, /dev/ttyACM*, and others).
 *    The autodetection for this kind of devices can potentially be unreliable.
 *
 *    Also, sending various bytes/commands to (all!) devices which happen to
 *    be attached to the system via a (real or virtual) serial port can be
 *    problematic. There is no way for libsigrok to know how unknown devices
 *    react to the bytes libsigrok sends. Potentially they could lead to the
 *    device getting into invalid/error states, losing/overwriting data, or...
 *
 * In addition to the detection, the devices that are found are also
 * initialized automatically. On some devices, this involves a firmware upload,
 * or other such measures.
 *
 * The order in which the system is scanned for devices is not specified. The
 * caller should not assume or rely on any specific order.
 *
 * After the system has been scanned for devices, the list of detected (and
 * supported) devices can be acquired via sr_dev_list().
 *
 * TODO: Error checks?
 * TODO: Option to only scan for specific devices or device classes.
 *
