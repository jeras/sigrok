/**
 * Remove unused probes from samples.
 *
 * Convert sample from maximum probes -- the way the hardware driver sent
 * it -- to a sample taking up only as much space as required, with
 * unused probes removed.
 *
 * The "unit size" is the number of bytes used to store probe values.
 * For example, a unit size of 1 means one byte is used (which can store
 * 8 probe values, each of them is 1 bit). A unit size of 2 means we can
 * store 16 probe values, 3 means we can store 24 probe values, and so on.
 *
 * If the data coming from the logic analyzer has a unit size of 4 for
 * example (as the device has 32 probes), but only 2 of them are actually
 * used in an acquisition, this function can convert the samples to only
 * use up 1 byte per sample (unit size = 1) instead of 4 bytes per sample.
 *
 * The output will contain the probe values in the order specified via the
 * probelist. For example, if in_unitsize = 4, probelist = [5, 16, 30], and
 * out_unitsize = 1, then the output samples (each of them one byte in size)
 * will have the following format: bit 0 = value of probe 5, bit 1 = value
 * of probe 16, bit 2 = value of probe 30. Unused bit(s) in the output byte(s)
 * are zero.
 *
 * The caller must make sure that length_in is not bigger than the memory
 * actually allocated for the input data (data_in), as this function does
 * not check that.
 *
 * @param in_unitsize The unit size (>= 1) of the input (data_in).
 * @param out_unitsize The unit size (>= 1) the output shall have (data_out).
 *                     The requested unit size must be big enough to hold as
 *                     much data as is specified by the number of enabled
 *                     probes in 'probelist'.
 * @param probelist Pointer to a list of probe numbers, numbered starting
 *                  from 0. The list is terminated with -1.
 * @param data_in Pointer to the input data buffer. Must not be NULL.
 * @param length_in The input data length (>= 1), in number of bytes.
 * @param data_out Variable which will point to the newly allocated buffer
 *                 of output data. The caller is responsible for g_free()'ing
 *                 the buffer when it's no longer needed. Must not be NULL.
 * @param length_out Pointer to the variable which will contain the output
 *                   data length (in number of bytes) when the function
 *                   returns SR_OK. Must not be NULL.
 *
 * @return SR_OK upon success, SR_ERR_MALLOC upon memory allocation errors,
 *         or SR_ERR_ARG upon invalid arguments.
 *         If something other than SR_OK is returned, the values of
 *         out_unitsize, data_out, and length_out are undefined.
