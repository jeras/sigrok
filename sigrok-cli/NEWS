0.3.1 (2012-05-30)
------------------

 * Add a ChangeLog file to the tarball.
 * -V option: If "-l 3" or higher is used, the PD description is shown, too.
 * -a option: Print optional/required PD probes. Example: sigrok-cli -a uart.
 * Fix compiling with "Homebrew" (Mac OS X).
 * Stacking order doesn't have to be specified if it's the same as the
   PD list. Example: sigrok-cli -i <file.sr> -a i2c,edid -s i2c,edid.
   The -s option is no longer required in this special case.
 * Only output module or PD output goes to stdout, everything else to stderr.
 * Improved error handling: Stop sigrok-cli upon various PD related errors.
 * New -A | --protocol-decoder-annotations option which allows the user to
   select which annotation types (and from which PD in the stack) to show.

 * Fix a Makefile.am bug which caused the generated ChangeLog files being
   accidentally deleted upon 'make distclean'.
